ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning project. It helps to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data. This project demonstrates EDA using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn on the popular **Titanic dataset**.

The goal of this EDA is to:
- Understand the dataset structure
- Identify missing values
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Clean data for further modeling or analysis
- Detect potential patterns or insights

ðŸ§  Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values)
- Univariate analysis (histograms, count plots)
- Bivariate analysis (box plots, bar charts)
- Correlation analysis with heatmap
- Group-wise aggregations for insights
